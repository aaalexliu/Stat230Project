##VARIABLE DESCRIPTION

date - This variable represents the specific date of the recorded Valentine Dining Hall swipes. 
timestamp - This variable represents a collection of the time period of each swipe that entered the Valentine Dining Hall. 

count - This variable represents the total number of entry swipes that were recorded at certain types of meals per day.  

Events - This variable represents the different major, all-day events that occurred during specific dates. 

type - This variable represents the type of meal it is, whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 

traditional - This variable represents the specific foods served on the “traditional” line, which is generally considered the main meal/course. 

Cluster_t75 - Unique categories for traditional meals. 108 groups now. Pairwise similarity scores were computed on the strings in the 'traditional' category for every meal, using a fuzzy string matching library in python. Then, different thresholds were applied to determine which strings were categorized as a match or not a match. After that, we start grouping by largest group to smallest group. We decided to use a threshold of 75 for now, as that gives a total of 108 unique groupings.

tag_cluster_t75 - Tags are autogenerated from each grouping by selecting a minimum of 6 highest frequency words. Further work will be needed to ensure uniqueness of tags.

Special features: There were some missing data points in terms of counts for certain days such as days in winter break and summer break. We plan on stripping those data points from our analysis.

This graph reveals the distribution of the number of swipes for individual meals. We see that there is a unimodal, left skewed distribution with a median of 833. The IQR is 527 swipes.
